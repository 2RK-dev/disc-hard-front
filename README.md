## 📦 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**To start the project:**

Using Yarn:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2RK-dev/disc-hard-front.git
cd dischard
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2RK-dev/disc-hard-front.git
cd dischard
npm install
npm run dev
```

**If you have Docker installed:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will set up the entire development environment inside containers.

**Windows/Mac Tips:**

- Make sure your `.env.local` file is created and correctly configured, see [Environment Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-environment-configuration) .
- On Windows, use **Git Bash** or **WSL** to run bash commands.
- On Mac, everything should work out of the box with Terminal.

**Development vs Production:**

- For development: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
- For production:

```bash
yarn build && yarn start
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

You will need a `.env.local` file at the root of your project. For now, it's empty by default, but it should at least include the following variables:

```env
# Backend URL
API_BASE_URL=your-api-url

# OAuth client (e.g., GitHub, Google)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# NextAuth secret key
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key

# Optional: Set the port
PORT=3000
```

To change the default port, set the `PORT` variable in `.env.local`. For example, to run on port 4000:

```env
PORT=4000
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
